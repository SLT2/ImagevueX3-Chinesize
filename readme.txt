# Imagevue X3 v0.21.4



SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
==================

1. Unpack the Imagevue X3 zip file into a temporary folder locally.

2. By FTP, upload all the files and folders inside the X3 folder to your website. You can upload to the root of your website, or into a subfolder.

Important!
------------------
Make sure to also upload the .htaccess file in the root. If you can't see this file, it means your file manager is hiding invisible items. Instead, you can rename the file "default.htaccess" to ".htaccess" directly on your server with FTP.

3. After upload, simply navigate to your website URL and follow the steps.

Diagnostics
------------------
If there are critical issues noted on the initial page-load, you should try to resolve them. If there are no critical issues, you can navigate to your X3 PANEL [yourwebsite.com/panel] settings and disable diagnostics.



FIRST STEPS
==================
Once your X3 application is working, you can start setting it up. First, you may wish to use the STYLER interface (accessible from the top left button in your X3 website) to review combinations of skins, colors, fonts and layouts. You can also start editing settings and creating pages from your X3 panel [yourwebsite.com/panel]. The X3 panel includes in-context help links which will help you on your way.
